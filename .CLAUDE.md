This Godot Project is a smaller part of a bigger game.

I am implementing a "cocktail mixing" minigame.

## Gameplay Overview

### Basic Mixing Flow

1. **Select Glass** - Each has different capacity (3-6 slots) and special properties
2. **Add Liquors** - Each liquor has flavor stats and a color
3. **Mix or Layer** - Choose to combine liquors or keep them separate
4. **Serve** - The final drink determines which secrets are highlighted during interrogation

### Flavor Stats System

There are six flavors:

- Volatile
- Caustic
- Resonant
- Drift
- Temporal
- Void

Each liquor has statistics for some of these flavors.
Typically, a liquor will have 1 main flavor, 1 secondary flavor, and 1 negative flavor.
The flavors are defined as resources inside `./resources/flavors`.

### Special Ingredients

Can add ONE special ingredient per drink (doesn't use glass capacity).
This is a temporary list of example purposes.

- **Stardust Bitters**: Caustic +3, all others -1
- **Entropy Syrup**: Multiple stats +2, all others -2
- **Quantum Foam**: Random +4 to one stat (changes each time)

The special ingredients are defined as resources inside `./resources/special_ingredients`.

### Glasses

Each glass a certain capacity (which is the amount of times you can pour a liquid inside).
They can also have predetermined special effects.

The glasses are defined as resources inside `./resources/glasses`.

### Layer System

**Creating Layers:**

- Each time you press MIX, all unmixed liquors in the glass combine into one layer
- Liquors added after mixing create a new layer on top
- Each layer has its own color and combined flavor stats

### Signatures

Special combinations of statistics or color can provide bonus effects.
A signature can be unlocked when the cocktail fulfills certains conditions:

1. Flavor-based
   Signatures that can be unlocked when the entire cocktail has a certain flavor profile (For example +5 Caustic and +5 Volatile).
2. Color-based
   Signatures that can be unlocked when the cocktail has a certain color.
3. Layer-based
   Signatures that can be unlocked when the cocktail has a certain amount of layers.

Signatures can involve conditions of multiple types (ex: flavor-based and layer-based).
For example:

- 2 layers share same dominant flavor stat (5+)
- At least 2 layers + Caustic value is decrescendo

The glasses are defined as resources inside `./resources/signatures`.

## Connection to the bigger game

The bigger game is an interactive Visual Novel where the player can click on words inside the dialog box itself in order to reveal potential "secrets" behind them.

There are several types of secrets (`./resources/secret_types`), such as "lie" and "omission".

When going through a dialogue (an "interrogation" phase), the player has to guess what words have secrets behind them.
In order to help the player, prior to talking to the characters, they can serve them drinks with a certain flavor profile.
This flavor profile will determine the pre-reveal percentage for certain types of "secrets".
A pre-revealed secret will have its associated word animated in a way that makes it easy for the player to know it hides a secret.

If the cocktail served has a 90% pre-reveal percentage for "lie" secrets, each "lie" present in the dialogue will have a 90% chance of being pre-revealed.

## Development Status

It's still very early in the development of the cocktail mixing mechanic, or the bigger game itself.
